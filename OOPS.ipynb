        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions or logic. These objects represent real-world entities and contain both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions/behaviors) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete, usable entity created from a class blueprint and contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Attributes (data)\n",
        "*   Methods (behaviors)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and although they work closely together, they solve different problems.\n",
        "  - Abstraction:Abstraction focuses on hiding complexity and showing only essential details.You expose what an object does, not how it does it. It simplifies complex systems by modeling classes at a high level.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Encapsulation: Encapsulation focuses on protecting data and bundling data with the methods that operate on it.Data (attributes) and methods are grouped into a single unit: a class. Internal data is hidden using access modifiers like private, protected, or public.It ensures controlled access through getters and setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods in Python (short for “double underscore” methods) are special, built-in methods that Python uses to enable certain behaviors in classes and objects.They are also called magic methods or special methods.They always start and end with two underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism that allows one class (child/subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (parent/superclass). It promotes code reuse, extensibility, and logical hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) means “many forms.”It allows different classes to define the same method name but behave differently when the method is called.In simple words: One interface, many implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to an object's data and controlling it through methods. Python doesn’t enforce strict access control like some languages (e.g., Java or C++), but it uses naming conventions and name mangling to support encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created from a class. Its job is to set up the object’s initial state (variables/attributes).The constructor in Python is always named: __init__()\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, class methods and static methods are special types of methods that belong to the class rather than to individual objects. They are defined using decorators and serve different purposes.\n",
        "  - Class Methods (@classmethod): A class method is a method that receives the class itself as the first argument instead of the object. The first parameter is always: cls (refers to the class)\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming where multiple methods in the same class share the same name but have different parameters (number or type). It allows the same method to behave differently depending on the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a feature that allows a subclass (child class) to provide a new implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class). This enables a child class to change or extend the behavior of inherited methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - A property decorator (@property) is used to turn a method into a “read-only” attribute or to control access to an attribute without changing the syntax used to access it. It provides a Pythonic way to implement getters, setters, and deleters.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface. Its importance lies in the flexibility, maintainability, and scalability it brings to software design. Here’s why polymorphism is important:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Simplifies Code and Improves Flexibility\n",
        "*   Supports Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Behavior)\n",
        "*   Enhances Code Reusability\n",
        "*   Makes Code Scalable and Extensible\n",
        "*   Supports Loose Coupling\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It can contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by its subclasses. Abstract classes are useful for defining a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it a widely used paradigm for software development.\n",
        "  OOP provides:\n",
        "*   Modularity\n",
        "*   Reusability\n",
        "*   Encapsulation and abstraction\n",
        "*   Polymorphism\n",
        "*   Maintainability and scalability\n",
        "*   Intuitive modeling of real-world problems\n",
        "  - All of these lead to more organized, flexible, and maintainable software.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - In Python (and most OOP languages), class variables and instance variables are both attributes of a class, but they differ in scope, lifetime, and behavior.\n",
        "  - Instance Variable: Belongs to a specific object (instance of a class). Each object has its own copy. Defined inside the constructor (__init__) using self.Changes to one object do not affect other objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class Variable: Belongs to the class itself, shared by all instances.Defined directly inside the class, outside any method. Changes to a class variable affect all instances (unless overridden in an instance).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a child class to combine functionality from multiple classes, promoting code reuse and more flexible designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "  - In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are dunder (double underscore) methods used to define how objects are represented as strings. They serve different purposes, mainly for human readability vs developer debugging.\n",
        "  - __str__ – User-Friendly String Representation\n",
        "  - Purpose: Provide a readable and informal string representation of the object.\n",
        "  - Should be informative for end-users.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - __repr__ – Developer-Friendly / Debug Representation\n",
        "  - Purpose: Provide an unambiguous string representation of the object, ideally one that can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "  - Should be useful for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent (or superclass) in a child (subclass). It allows a subclass to reuse or extend the behavior of the parent class without explicitly naming it.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor—a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. It allows you to perform cleanup actions before the object’s memory is released.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods inside a class that don’t require an instance to be called, but they behave differently.\n",
        "  - @staticmethod\n",
        "  - Does not take self or cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "  - Acts like a regular function inside a class, logically grouped with the class.\n",
        "  - Cannot access instance attributes or class attributes.\n",
        "  - Used for utility or helper functions related to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - @classmethod\n",
        "  - Takes cls as the first parameter (refers to the class itself).\n",
        "  - Can access class attributes or other class methods.\n",
        "  - Often used for alternative constructors or modifying class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface, and it works seamlessly with inheritance. Essentially, it enables method overriding so that a child class can provide its own implementation of a method defined in a parent class.\n",
        "  - Parent class defines a method\n",
        "  - Child class overrides that method to provide its own behavior\n",
        "  - At runtime, Python decides which method to execute based on the object type, not the variable type.\n",
        "  - This is called runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after another. This is usually achieved by having methods return the object itself (self) after performing their operations. It makes the code more concise and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method in Python is a special (dunder) method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. In other words, if a class defines __call__, its objects become callable objects.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Purpose of __call__\n",
        "  - Makes objects behave like functions.\n",
        "  - Allows encapsulation of behavior in an object while keeping a function-like interface.\n",
        "  - Useful for callbacks, decorators, or function factories.\n",
        "  - Can maintain state in the object while being callable."
